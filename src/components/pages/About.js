            After studying in mechanical engineering for a years, i questioned myself, is this what i really want do?.
            I left the university as the course didn't interest me. To try new things i started working in contruction,
            It wasn't bad but i always had interest in working with technology and coding was the only subject i enjoyed.
            while looking for places to study i found a opportunity in a coding boot camp.
          </p>
          <p className="lightb">
            Currently a student enrolled in bootcamp to learn the basic of coding and would like use this skills in the future to pursue 
            a career in software development or use this as a base to study further to learn multiple languages. I'd describe myself as 
            a person with a lot of curiosity and a love for learning new things that i have no experience in.
